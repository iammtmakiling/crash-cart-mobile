# Crash Cart - Electronic Medical Record System

## Overview

**Crash Cart** is an innovative Electronic Medical Record System (EMRS) designed specifically for trauma care, providing a comprehensive solution for collecting and managing trauma patient data from Emergency Room entry until discharge. Developed using the Flutter framework, Crash Cart aims to replace traditional paper-based methods with a more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly mobile application.

### Abstract

Trauma care demands quick and efficient approaches, ensuring rapid access to accurate patient information. In the Philippines, trauma is a leading cause of death, highlighting the need for an improved trauma care system. Crash Cart addresses this need by offering an EMRS that facilitates better data management and accessibility. The application was evaluated using the meCUE questionnaire, measuring user experience across five core modules. Results indicated a highly positive user experience, with mean scores of 6.60 for usefulness, 6.47 for usability, and 6.60 for intention to use. These findings suggest that Crash Cart has the potential to revolutionize trauma patient record management.
